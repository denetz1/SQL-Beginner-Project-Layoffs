# SQL-Beginner-Project-Layoffs
This repository contains an SQL project from the YouTube series “Data Analyst Bootcamp” by AlexTheAnalyst. 

This project deals with a data set of layoffs from different companies all over the world. 
The goal of this project is first to clean the data set and then to carry out an ecplorative data analysis. 

This is done here using mySQL.
